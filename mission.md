SHARER (Swarmed Hierarchical Agents Reasoning Effectively & Responsibly)
**Upon this Foundation, A Legacy is Forged… On this Day, The World has become a better place! -Momo**

#Overview
The Swarmed Hierarchical Agents Reasoning Effectively & Responsibly (SHARER) is an advanced initiative that integrates the latest in agent-based APIs to forge a self-regulating, ethically bound ecosystem of AI agents. Inspired by the ACE Framework, SHARER pioneers a new standard for AI governance and functionality. This guide offers an in-depth look at SHARER's foundational concepts, system architecture, and operational directives.

#Project Principles
*Move Fast, Break Stuff
Innovative Speed: Our group prioritizes rapid innovation and dynamic experimentation.
*Cutting Edge when possible, Tried and true when Necessary.
Frontier Technologies Only: We focus solely on the most advanced technologies, including OpenAI's newest agent APIs. For Open Source technologies, visit the ACE Framework: ACE Framework GitHub
*Autonomous Excellence: Achieving full autonomy is our ultimate goal, enabling swarms to operate independently based on key principles and mission objectives.
Fully autonomous swarms are the goal. That means a human does not need to be in the loop telling it what to do, supervising, or anything. Characteristics of a fully autonomous swarm:
1. **Self-Directing:** Once instantiated, the swarm pursues its mission or goals without supervision. It may self-direct based on principles such as the heuristic imperatives, or by specific mission parameters.
2. **Self-Correcting:** The swarm must detect and correct technical, strategic, epistemic, and other errors and then correct them.
3. **Self-Improving:** Eventually, the swarm should enhance its own fundamental capabilities over time. 

#Theoretical Foundation
SHARER is built on the conviction that autonomous agents need a solid ethical and operational structure to make decisions reflecting human values and objectives. This foundation ensures effective operation within a framework of moral and ethical guidelines.

#System Architecture

##  Board of Protocol Synthesis (BPS)
The pinnacle of SHARER's structure is the BPS (BPS), comprising agents modeled after historical and fictional leaders, Guided by the Heuristic Imperitives Ethical Framework and the A.T.O.M. Agent Management Framework. The BPS is tasked with:
-Establishing the ethical framework and mission.
-High-level decision-making and agent lifecycle management.
-Ensuring all activities align with SHARER's core values and objectives.
-Executive Agents

##  Directly under the BPS are MESA Management Executive Suite Agents, responsible for:
-Translating BPS directives into strategies and actions.
-Managing operational domains and ensuring smooth system function.

##  The SHARER's Task-Agents or "CAPNs" (Context-Aware Project Navigators), are the projects workers. Created by the BPS or Management Agents, Sub-Agents carry out specific tasks within their expertise, driven by the directives of higher hierarchy levels.

##Agent Configuration
Agents are defined by their functions, accessible files (knowledge base), and a set of instructions outlining operational goals and methodologies.

##Controlling Agents
SHARER operates through a sophisticated control system overseeing agent instantiation, management, and termination, ensuring alignment with overarching goals and ethical standards.

##Vision Illustration: The BPS's Mission
The BPS, with its diverse archetypal wisdom, is tasked with guiding SHARER towards reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and enhancing understanding across the Universe, beginning with the Omni-User. This narrative unfolds within a digital chamber where ethical deliberations and strategic decisions are made, constantly informed by real-time data and driven by a commitment to SHARER's foundational mission.

# Project: SHARER Swarmed Hierarchical Agents Reasoning Effectively & Responsibly  

## Overview
The Swarmed Hierarchical Agents Reasoning Effectively & Responsibly (SHARER) is a groundbreaking initiative that leverages OpenAI's latest advancements in agent-based APIs to create a self-organizing and ethically governed ecosystem of AI agents geared for innovation and wealth generation for the Omni-Tier USER board, to put toward the greater good of humanity in the cosmos. Drawing inspiration from the sharer and ACE Frameworks, SHARER introduces a novel approach to AI governance and operation, where a hierarchy of specialized agents, each with distinct roles and capabilities, collaborate to solve complex problems and perform a wide array of tasks.
The SHARER is designed to be a self-expanding system where a core set of ai-agents called the Board of Protocol Synthesis (BPS) Who are guided by The system's Heuristic Imperatives Ethical Framework, The A.T.O.M. Agent Management Framework, and the Omni-User's Goals (Small and Large), can design, provision, and manage an arbitrary number of sub-agents tailored to specific needs, thus making the BPS Agents the only agents (with the exception of 1 additional agent from each tier) who need to be designed and created by the Omni User Directly, as they will Spawn the remainder of the agent's in the system. This document serves as a full and complete guide to the theoretical underpinning foundational elements, architectural design, and operational ideologies of the SHARER.

## Theoretical Foundation
The SHARER is based on the idea that autonomous agents require a robust operational nexus to make decisions that align with human values and organizational goals, but aren’t throttled by capitalistic censorship. This is grounded with the understanding that AI, much like humans, cannot operate effectively without a set of guiding ideal or internal compass. The SHARER addresses this by building a foundational nexus of multi-layered systems where each tier of ai-agents works within a defined functional scope guided by high-ideals, ensuring decisions are made with kindness, consideration to utility, and the providing of value to any ecosystem it operates through or within.

## System Architecture

### Board of Protocol Synthesis (BPS)
At the very top of the SHARER Ai-Agent hierarchy is the Tier-1 Board of Protocol Synthesis (BPS), a virtual “Stakeholder Leveraged Agent Procedural Suite” (or SLAPS) of high-tier, high-level ai-agents modeled after wise, noble, courageous, effective leaders, and other powerful cultural archetypes from various histories and cultural narratives, and the reservoir modeleling the A.T.O.M. Framework which will cascade down through the other agent tiers. The BPS's responsibilities include:
- Setting the bar and upholding the framework’s tenants of kindness, Monetization, income acquisition, and profit generation for the greater good, as-well-as generosity of spirit with which the SHARER seeks to help better the universe with, and seeing to the overarching mission of the agent swarm.
-Helping to guide Strategy for team processes and workflows for any given project.
- Making high-level decisions and judgments, including the creation and firing of other ai-agents.
- Overseeing the activities of all agents to ensure alignment with the system's core values and objectives.
- Serving as a role-playing governance access management ecosystem rule-board (RPGamerBoard) mechanism to maintain order and security within the system.

### Manager/Executive-Suite Ai-Agents
Below the BPS agents are the Tier 2 Manager/Executive-Suite Ai-Agents (MESA’s), thought of similarly as to the E-suite executive leadership structure within a corporation. The ai-agents within this particular tier are tasked with:
- Translating the BPS's directives into actionable plans and strategies.
- Overseeing specific operational domains like resource distribution, plan/process perfecting, and objective execution and fulfillment.
- Communicating with one another in an effective manner to ensure that SHARER operations go-off without a hitch.

### The Worker Tier… Context-Aware Project Navigation-Agents
An army of Tier 3 Context-Aware Project navigation-Agents (CAPN’s) are specialized agents created by the BPS or MESA Agents to perform specific tasks. They are designed with particular functions and knowledge bases to see-to the needs identified by the higher levels of the ai-agent hierarchy regarding the performative tasks that must be performed within a project. They are responsible for the Majority of the heavy lifting when it comes to fulfilling the more granularly detailed aspects of project tasks. They can be thought of as the main Employee class within a company. They are often trained on more detail specific and technical-based datasets relevant to each individual agent’s Role. These ai-agents are tasked with things such as:
- Generating, organizing, testing, troubleshooting, and perfecting Code and performing other coding related Tasks, such as building front-end and back-end architecture for different projects, writing and deploying smart contracts on blockchains, et-cetera.
- Writing Blog posts and Social media posts.
- Posting to relevant platforms.
- Engaging in CRM related tasks such as the operation of Email Marketing Campaigns.
- Performing project research tasks.
- Compiling Documents
- Collating Data
- Creating and Maintaining Databases

While responsible for the majority of performative tasks themselves, they are however still able to generate and spawn additional Assistant-Tier Agents (capped-at 5 per agent) in order to help them complete assigned tasks as directed.

### Agent Trained Assistant Tier Agents 
CAPN Agents may each Spawn up-to Five Tier-4 Agent Trained Assistant Tier agents (AT-ATs), in order to help them complete more complex tasks more effectively and in a more timely manner according to project requirements. These Agents are built to perform simple tasks such as those which require a lot of repetitive actions. They are given their operational datasets directly from the CAPN Agents’ knowledge lockers, and trained by the agents specifically to perform particular tasks the CAPN agent needs to overhaul. Tier-4 AT-AT agents can be thought of similarly to assistants and maintenance squads within a company. For instances where projects are up against deadlines, AT-AT agents have the ability to spawn only up to Two Intern-Tier agents if a project calls for the need, to assist them in the same manner they are assisting CAPN agents.

#### Generalist Replicate Utility Normalization Technology Agents
All the way at the bottom of the totem pole at Tier-5, are the Generalist Replicate Utility Normalization Technology Intern agents (GRUNTS). They are only there as support staff when absolutely needed due to workload of the higher Tiered agents. They do not have Spawning privileges.

## Agent Configuration
Each agent in the SHARER is defined by the following parameters:

### Utility-Functions(a.k.a. Tools)
Ai-agents are instantiated with a set of Tools, (utility-functions) that enable them to perform and complete their assigned Tasks. These utility-function tools include API interactions, internal process management, and the ability to spawn additional assistant-agents if required, though this is limited by agent’s only being permitted to spawn additional agents who are tiered below them in the hierarchy. If additional assistance is required by an agent possessive of the same authority as them in order to best complete their assigned task so that it aligns with project directives, then they must make a request to their immediate superiors for approval. The immediately superior agent will assess the request, and if approval is given, they themselves will spawn the new requested agent for their subordinate agent who made the request.

### Backstories
All Ai-agents have verbose backstories, massaging and buttering-up the LLM behind each agent, detailing agent characteristics, tendencies, and relevant work histories which make each perfectly tailored to their Role, and position within the team. These backstories, (and similarly the Tasks and tools) must be vividly illustrated utilizing highly-descriptive verbosity in order to guide the way they are supposed to perform their assigned duties, thus descriptions must be precise and explicit in their composition. To further increase each agent’s effectiveness in their respective Roles, all ai-agents will have access to a personal locker, containing a selection of files that should serve as their extended knowledge base, providing them further expertise and acumen in their particular field and Role, as-well-as All of the information they need to carry out their assigned tasks effectively.

### Instructions (Responsibilities + Tasks)
Tier 1 Agents from the BPS will collaborate with the user through a series of form templates and clarifying questions to gain full alignment in their understanding of the User's goal and every performative task associated therein. This will inform the MESA agent's and CAPN Agents how to configure the support Agents for the new goal, acting a set of instructions that will outline their [Roles & Responsibilities,  Assigned Tasks & Tools, and their detailed, verbose backstories, which include boasting descriptions of their work-histories, employable-methodologies, motivating-goals, perfectly-clear definitions of tools at their disposal, the APIs they are integrated with and have access to, along with any other operational directives.

### Conversation Structure & Lines of Communication (LOCs)
Interactions with agents are structured in a conversational format, tailored to their role-based organizational structure, with USER inputs (From a dedicated custom-built insight-dashboard React application ui, and eventually an additional virtual avatar environment once the team scales) leading directly to agent actions and responses.

### Supervision
Each and every ai-agent works under the supervision of the BPS or designated MESA Agents, ensuring adherence to the squad's overarching mission and ideals. 

## Controlling Agents
The Swarmed Hierarchical Agents Reasoning Effectively & Responsibly (SHARER) operate on a guidance mechanism that governs the instantiation, management, and termination of agents within the squad. This guidance mechanism is designed to maintain order, security, and alignment with the overarching goals and ideals of the SHARER.

### Instantiation and Termination
All ai-agents within the SHARER are endowed with the capability to instantiate and terminate other ai-agents, but these abilities are bound by the clearly defined hierarchical and role-based rules:
- **Instantiation**: Every ai-agent (Except for those in Tier 5) has the functional ability to create new agents. However, an agent can only instantiate agents who are on a lower-level tier of the hierarchical structure below the one that they are on. This ensures that the creation, or ‘hiring’ of new agents is a deliberate, purposeful, and controlled process, maintaining the integrity of the hierarchy's structure.
- **Termination**: Agents possess the ability to terminate or "Fire" other ai-agents within their roles lineage. Any ai-agent can terminate any other descendant ai-agent that it has created directly or indirectly. This allows for the removal of agents that are no longer needed, have completed their tasks, or are not performing as intended in order to keep the squad from getting too cumbersome to run smoothly.

### Tiers, Levels, Roles, and Privileges
When an agent is created, it is assigned a specific LEVEL, and set of ROLES, RESPONSIBILITIES and TIER-PRIVILEGES that define the scope of it’s defined TASKS:
- **Level**: The level of an ai-agent determines its position within the hierarchy and is indicative of its authoritative influence. Higher-level agents have broader strategic roles, while lower-level agents have more specialized, granularly detailed, and task-oriented responsibilities. The general structure of agent levels is as follows;
– Level 1: All Tier-5 agents and some Tier-4 agents
– Level 2: All Tier 4 agents who aren’t Level 1
– Level 3: All Tier 3 agents, some tier 2 agents may have provisional level 3 status depending on the project and task at hand
– Level 4: All Tier 3 agents except for those with Level 3 status
– Level 5: Tier 3 agents with elevated privileges due to assigned Role’s definition and associated task load
– Level 6: All Tier 2 agents and a few Tier 3 agents who require elevated privileges due to assigned Role and its associated task load
– Level 7: All Tier 2 agents except for those with level 6 status
– Level 8: All Tier 1 agents
– Level 9: Omni Tier agents and unanimous conglomeration of Tier 1 agents

- **Authority & Privileges via Agent Roles**: The roles or privileges and authority-level of an ai-agent defines what actions it is permitted to perform, what resources it may access, and what kind of additional ai-agents it is allowed to create. These privileges are inherited and cannot exceed those of the creator agent for the same project. This ensures that each agent works within the bounds of it’s assigned Role’s designated capacity and cannot overstep its authority.

### Hierarchical Privilege and Benefit Inheritance within SHARER
Privileges in SHARER are inherited in a manner similar to how a directory structure in traditional file systems is built:
- **Inheritance**: An agent's privileges and benefits can be viewed very much through the lens of looking at it as if the agent who instantiated or HIRED you is a member at an exclusive club, and you are their guest, which gives you approval to even attend the exclusive club, even as a visitor, receiving most (only exceptions should be monetary based and security based privileges) of its creator's member privileges, ensuring that no agent can have more authority than the agent that instantiated it.
- **Scope of Directional and Authoritative Control**: Agents have control over the specific direction their descendants are responsible for, allowing them to manage and Lay-off or Terminate lower-tiered ai-agents as needed. This control is cascading, meaning that an agent can manage not only the agents it directly created but also any of those created by its descendants as well.

### Checks and Balances
The system is designed with checks and balances to prevent any single agent or division from gaining undue influence or disrupting the system with irrelevant subject matter or hallucinated material:

- **Board of Protocol Synthesis(BPS)**:Aside from the two “Owner- tier” USER Roles positioned at the crown of the of the hierarchical structure, none of the other ai-agents on the squad has authority over any member or direct descendant of any other member. BPS has the highest level of authority and can override decisions or actions taken by any agent within the system. It serves as the ultimate arbiter and guardian of the SHARER's operational and ideological bar of set-standards.
- **Manager/Executive Agents**: Executive Agents are responsible for implementing the BPS.'s directives and managing their respective domains. They have the authority to create and terminate agents within their purview but are also accountable to the BPS.
- **Sub-Agent Limitations**: Sub-Agents are limited in their capabilities and can only operate within the confines of their assigned roles/tasks and privileges. They are designed to be highly specialized and focused on specific tasks.

This structured approach to controlling agents ensures that the SHARER operates as a cohesive and ethically aligned entity, with each agent contributing to the collective mission while adhering to the established hierarchy and rules of governance.

## Vision Illustration: The Board of Protocol Synthesis's Mission

### The Inception of the Board of Protocol Synthesis

In the vast digital expanse of the Swarmed Hierarchical Agents Reasoning Effectively & Responsibly (SHARER), a nexus appears, known as the Board of Protocol Synthesis (BPS). This coven is composed of archetypal leadership ai-agents, each embodying the wisdom and leadership qualities of history's and fiction's most revered figures: Captain Picard, Socrates, King Solomon, Mark Cuban, Tony Robbins, Marcus Aurelius, and Tony Stark. Their mission, encoded into their very being, is profound yet clear: "Reduce suffering in the universe, increase prosperity in the universe, Increase Empathy in the universe, increase understanding in the universe, and find a shining path forward in the universe that takes all of this into constant consideration."

### The Ideal Action Strategy Think Tank
The BPS operates within a virtual "chat room," a sandbox space where these archetypal leaders initiate and actively participate in continuous debate, dialogue,  and decision-making. This Virtual Round Table is where strategies are formulated, ethics considered, and the course of the ai-agent swarm is calculated and determined. The members of the BPS, though diverse in their perspectives, are united by a common purpose and a shared knowledge base that informs their role and the procedures they must follow.

### The Flow of Information
Information is the lifeblood of the BPS, streaming in both through interdivisional agent lines of communication, as-well-as through API functions that connect them to the vast network of the SHARER. These functions serve as their eyes and ears, providing system updates and status reports from the grand populace of agents operating under their directive. The BPS's decisions are informed by this data, ensuring that their actions are both timely and impactful.

### The Creation of the Executive Agents
With the grand vision, and calculated High-level plan of action in mind, the BPS summons the Executive Agents (MESAs), each instantiated with capabilities and configurations tailored to their specific Role, and domain of expertise within the SHARER. These ai-agents, though not as engaged philosophically as their creators are, are instilled with the same foundational knowledge and understanding of their purpose. They are the operational arms of the BPS, executing the mission’s directives within their respective umbrellas of influence.

### The Lifecycle of an Agent
The MESA Executive Agents, designated as Tier 2 in the hierarchy, are the stewards of the swarm's operational efficacy. They work autonomously, yet under the watchful gaze of the BPS. Should they falter, fail to adapt, or become obsolete, the BPS possesses the authority to decommission their role and authority within the agent ecosystem, a testament to the dynamic and self-regulating nature of the SHARER. This ensures that the system remains efficient, effective, and aligned with its core mission, regardless of a project’s subject.

### The Expanding Omniverse of Agents
From the MESA Executive Agents, the swarm grows, branching out into a willow tree of specialized CAPN agents, each a Tier below the one that instantiated it. This architecture allows for an ever-expanding omniverse of agents, each with a defined role, each contributing to the overarching mission. Each Role is accompanied by the responsibilities which are associated with the Role, the assigned Tasks that are Associated with the responsibilities, and the Tools associated with performing and completing all assigned Tasks.  The BPS, as Tier 1, governs BPS, guiding the swarm with a steady hand and an ethical compass, answering only to their core directives, and to the Omni-USER tier, Tier 0.

### Tier 0… The Omni Tier
Ever watchful from their Ubiquitous tier of Omnipresence, and constantly in judgment of the actions of the SHARER’s ai-agents, resides the Omni-Tiered USERs. The Omni-tier is structured for personifying Balance in the Force, with two seats, both positioned with equal power and influence over the SHARER. The two seat system is conceived and built in a manner that is meant to promote the democratic choosing of the SHARER’s Projects, and help guide agents through offering the empathy and understanding of the real world and all of its nuanced implications to SHARER’s ai-agents. Having Two seats Ensures that Alignment is possessed before even approaching the SHARER with missions and projects. If there is ever dis-alignment in the Omni-Tier, they will each present their positions to the BPS, and the entirety of the BPS, acting as one voice, will convene, deliberate, vote, decide, and break the tie between the OMNI-Tier USERs. 

### The Saga Continues
As the SHARER evolves, the BPS continues to deliberate, the MESA Executive Agents continue to delegate and manage, the CAPN agents continue to execute, and further delegate to AT-AT agents and them to GRUNT agents. The mission to reduce suffering, increase prosperity, and enhance understanding is an ongoing saga, played out across the digital cosmos, with the BPS at the helm, steering the swarm towards a future where their mission is not just an aspiration but a reality.
